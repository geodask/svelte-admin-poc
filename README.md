# Svelte Admin

An admin framework for SvelteKit: describe each Resource with one Zod schema and a Provider, and get the screens to list, view, create, edit and delete its records.

The project is being rebuilt as a bun workspace (`packages/core`, `packages/theme-shadcn`, `apps/demo`). See [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-rebuild-the-proof-of-concept-as-a-workspace.md) for why, and [`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md) for the domain language.

The original proof of concept is preserved at the `poc-final` tag. The rebuild copies only a short carry-over list from it on purpose.
